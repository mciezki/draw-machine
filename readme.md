## DRAW MACHINE
________________

Small training project - just for more practice with class methods and trying sth with setInterval().

First what user has to do is type tasks (for example - do you not know what to do today? Type your ideas!). Then click "Let's draw!" and look at the result :)

### AGAIN NO MOBILE VERSION :>
